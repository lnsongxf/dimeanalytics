## Remote Access to Bank Virtual Machines

The World Bank Citrix system can provide two functions. First, it can access a virtual World Bank desktop from any personal computer. These instructions are below. Second, it also be set up by ITS to provide a secure and powerful server interface for your team to store and analyze data using Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). Contact [DIME Analytics](mailto:dimeanalytics@worldbank.org) for more information.

You are able to access a virtual World Bank desktop from any personal computer using [Citrix Workspace](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/workspace-app/). This is close to, but not exactly the same, as you logging in to your World Bank desktop. The difference is that you will not have access to any software installed on your desktop in a local drive (for example Stata) and you will not have access to files saved locally (for example in the Documents folder). The virtual desktop behaves as if you are logging in to a new World Bank computer for the first time. You will not have your local files, but you will have access to networks, OneDrive access, Intranet, etc. that you have from World Bank desktops.

To login to a Virtual Desktop, follow the following steps:

1. [Download the Citrix software](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/workspace-app/) for the device you are using (PC, Mac etc.)
1. After the download is complete, open the software and follow its instructions. When you are asked to enter an "email or server address", enter: _myconnect.wbg.org_
1. Then you will be asked to enter your UPI (in the format _wb123456_), the Windows password for your World Bank computer, and the passcode you are using for your token.
    1. If you are using an email token you will get one more window asking you to enter the code sent to your email.
1. After you are logged in you will get to a menu where you can select which software you are accessing. You can also click "Desktop" to access a virtual version of a World Bank computer.
1. (OPTIONAL) If you know the property number of your WB computer(small silver sticker with a 7 digit number), then you can access your own World Bank desktop and local files.
    * Click on the "Bookmark" button at the top right of the "Desktops" page.
    * On the new window that pops up, in the row labeled 'URL' , put "PC" followed by the property number. For example - PC1234567 if your property number is 1234567.
    * In the 'Name' row, put a name such as "World Bank desktop" and click "Save".
    * Now double click on the new "World Bank desktop" icon to launch your remote desktop.

If you have never logged in on a World Bank computer and therefore do not have a Windows password yet, you should call IT support on 32121 from any World Bank phone, or +1-202-473-2121 from any phone.
