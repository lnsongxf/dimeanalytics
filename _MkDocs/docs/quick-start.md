# New Hire Onboarding Guide

Welcome to DIME! Please review and complete the following steps so that you can have a happy and successful time at DIME. If you have any questions, contact DIME Analytics: [dimeanalytics@worldbank.org](mailto:dimeanalytics@worldbank.org).

## Visit the DIME Analytics Resource Guide.

​​Visit <http://worldbank.github.io/dimeanalytics> and bookmark it!

## Get a World Bank email account.

​​Your supervisor should request an “email and computer logon” for you using eServices. Once this is issued, they will forward you the login. Log into a World Bank workstation, then open Outlook. Webmail can be accessed on a personal computer via the external [World Bank webmail](https://webmail.worldbank.org/).

## Get a logon token.

​​Visit GRAS (take the 400’s elevator to Ground Floor, then walk away from the lobby) and ask them for a token setup, after requesting in eServices. This enables you to log into Bank services from personal devices.

## Schedule onboarding with DIME Analytics.

​​Email [dimeanalytics@worldbank.org](mailto:dimeanalytics@worldbank.org) to schedule an onboarding meeting with Ben or Luiza.

## Get a computer and software.

​​DIME Analytics will provide software setup for Stata 15, Git, Dropbox, and much more. The World Bank has several other useful software/webapp subscriptions you can access. Details are on the [Resource Guide](http://worldbank.github.io/dimeanalytics).

## Explore the Intranet.

​​Open an Internet Explorer window on a Bank machine and type “furl” in the address bar. This will give you a crazy long list of short-urls that link to various internal resources. Some important ones are: “myspam”, “travel”, “eservices”, and “strequest”. You can also access these resources using Citrix Receiver, from <http://myconnect.wbg.org>.

## Get paid.

​​Send your bank details to [dimesupport@worldbank.org](mailto:dimesupport@worldbank.org). Then visit <http://strequest> on the Intranet or access <http://strequest.worldbank.org> using your logon token to submit invoices and deliverables. You should do this biweekly unless you need other accommodations for temporary full-time status (talk to your supervisor). Here is what is required to be submitted:
​
> Bank name : Full name of the bank.​
>
> Bank address : Street, branch location, city and country.
>
> Account holder name : Must be in the name of the consultant, no other account will be accepted.
>
> Account number : Bank account number
>
> Routing code/number : Banks in US will have 9 digits direct deposit ABA number
>
> SWIFT code : SWIFT Code of the bank's branch. Usually contains 8 or 11 characters.
>
> IBAN number : Required for European banks.

## Explore the HQ resources.
​​World Bank HQ has a vast selection of on-site resources for you, including a credit union (bank), gym, passport photos, business cards, mailing/shipping center, health clinic, and library.

## Apply for an LP passport.
​​If you are expected to travel for business, the World Bank provides a special passport. Inquire with DIME Analytics for details if this is necessary. Make sure you do so well in advance of your travel dates.

## Get health insurance.
​​There is a Bank-organized health insurance option for STCs. Ask for more information.

## Printing at the World Bank
​​You can print from a Bank computer or a Citrix virtual machine from <http://myconnect.wbg.org>, or you can email your documents to wbgmobileprint@worldbank.org.

## Driver’s Licenses and ID Requirements
​​It is possible to get a driving license or state ID where you reside (DC, VA, or MD). Requirements vary by state, but it is better than taking your passport to the bar! Many DC venues will NOT accept an international ID card other than a passport and are very strict on ID for 21+ at most bars and clubs.

## Acronyms
​​The World Bank Group (WBG) is an “alphabet soup”. You work in DIME (Development Impact Evaluations), which is officially titled DECIE (Development Economics Impact Evaluations), part of the DEC (Development Economics) VPU (Vice Presidency Unit). Your TTL (Task Team Leader) is responsible for you, an STC (Short-Term Contractor). When you submit SOEs (Statements of Expenses), make sure you have a valid TR (Travel Request) in the SAP (???) system!
